Project Description

CHAT is a simple message interchange system designed for students in a classroom environment. It allows students to communicate with each other through a web-based interface while connected to a local network.

Tech Stack

Backend: Python (ServerIo.py)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Networking: Works over a local network using IP and port 8080

Installation & Setup

Server-Side

Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed on a Windows environment.
Download and extract the "Chat.rar" file that includes all the code files and python libriries.  
The "ServerIO.py" is in the main directory.
The "static" folder includes the backend files.

Run the server script:

python ServerIo.py

Client-Side (Students)

Open a web browser.

Enter the server's IP address followed by port 8080, e.g.:

http://192.168.1.13:8080

The chat interface should load, allowing students to send and receive messages.

All users should be on the same local network.

The chat interface supports real-time message exchange.
